# IMDBTypeApp using React JS

This project was developed by a team I had the pleasure working with while attending The Informal School of IT's Web Development course. <br/>
My part in this project was to develop the search Page for a IMDB like Movie App. <br/>
I used function components and React Hooks to achieve the results. <br/>
The app is based on an API that sends data about certain movies. <br/>
